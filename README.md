# recipe_search_API
This is a project based on the Edamam API search. It allows to type one ingredient, randomly select a type of cuisine and then search for a number of recipes 
with this ingredient from that randomly selected cuisine. You can save the list of recipes in a file, then select a certain dish and get a full list of
ingredients for it.
